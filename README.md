# BlessModelThe purpose of this package is to save, update, delete, force delete, and restore data using a recursive array. It understands both an associative array for working with one record, and with a dataset for working with several records at once.## InstallationYou can install the library using composer:```bashcomposer require bfg/bless_model```## Beginning of workFirst, you need to design your models and their relationships.## How to useFor convenience, the main method has been brought into the alias `BlessModel`. All you need to do is call the `do` method.```php\BlessModel::do(\App\Models\User::class, []);```Let's imagine that our user model has the following relationships:### profile - hasOne```phpclass Profile extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {       protected $fillable = ["first_name","last_name","age","about"];}```### roles - belongsToMany```phpclass Role extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {       protected $fillable = ["slug","name"];}```### posts - hasMany```phpclass Post extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {       protected $fillable = ["subject","text"];}```### commentaries - morphMany```phpclass Commentary extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model {       protected $fillable = ["text"];}```And in order to fill in this data, you need to do the following:```php\BlessModel::do(\App\Models\User::class, [    "name" => "DoctorWho",    "email" => "user@test.com",    "profile" => [        "first_name" => "Doctor",        "last_name" => "Who",        "age" => 2200,        "about" => "An eccentric alien traveler of a great mind who fights injustice."    ],    "role" => [        "slug" => "time_lord",        "name" => "Time Lord",    ],    "posts" => [        [            "subject" => "About TARDIS",            "text" => "The TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space) is a time machine and spacecraft that appears in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who and its various spin-offs."        ]           ],    "commentaries" => [        [            "text" => "Butterflies are cool!"        ],        [            "text" => "Yowzah!"        ],        [            "text" => "Geronimo!"        ]    ]]);```
